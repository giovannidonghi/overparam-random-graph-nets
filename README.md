# overparam-random-graph-nets

This repository contains the implementation of experiments from the paper "Investigating over-parameterized randomized graph networks", published in Neurocomputing. The study explores the impact of over-parameterization on graph neural models using randomized features for graph classification tasks. Key contributions include the use of Algorithmic Stability (via Gram matrix condition number) and entropy measures to evaluate model generalization performance, alongside empirical analysis on multiple benchmark graph datasets.
